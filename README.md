# Tamagotchi_battler
This is a tamagotchi-like virtual pet simulater on an esp32!

You feed, pet, and take care of your pet.
To make it a little bit more fun, you can put your pet against another in a turn-based battle. The esp32-s communicates through esp-NOW, there is no need for any initial set-up on the user's side. This allows for a seemless and robust connection during the battle.
